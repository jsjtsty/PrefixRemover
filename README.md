# PrefixRemover
A simple tool to remove prefix/suffix of files.

# Description
**Used C++ 17 features.**

Just a simple project I programmed to review the C++ programming language.

**Visual Studio 2019** required if compiled on Windows.

# Tips
This program can be compiled on Linux. The modified source code is placed under **GNU** directory.

***gcc version 9+*** required, but currently fully test on only gcc 10.1.
